This node is recommended for use with LCM.

1. Git clone this repo to the ComfyUI/custom_nodes path.

   `git clone https://github.com/toyxyz/ComfyUI_toyxyz_test_nodes`

2. Run setup.bat in `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI_toyxyz_test_nodes/CaptureCam`

### 1. Load Webcam Image

 Load an image from a path. 

 To use this node with webcam, you must first run run.bat in `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI_toyxyz_test_nodes/CaptureCam`.

 And in the Webcam app, you'll need to select your webcam and run capture with start.

### 2. Capture Webcam

Captures an image directly from the webcam selected with 'select_webcam'.

This is very slow compared to the Load Webcam Image node. 

If you're using LCM, I recommend using the Load Webcam Image node.

### 3. Save image to path

This node saves the generated images to a defined path. 

If save_sequence is true, it saves the images in order without overwriting them.

### 4. Webcam app

This script captures the selected webcam and saves it as an image file in real-time. 

You can specify the resolution, format, and path of the image to be saved. 

If you don't enter a path, it will be saved to the default path. 

If either the width or height is zero, it will be automatically adjusted to fit the other values entered. 

You can combine a sequence of saved images into a video using the Export button. Make sure to set save_sequence in Save Image to Path to true. 

To use AI Render, you need a Save Image to Path node.

If you entered a location other than the default path in Save Image to Path, you must select a newly created render image in Select Rendered image.

### 5. Render preview

Load the image file saved with the Save image to path node. Pressing 'Q' while the window is active will copy the preview image to the clipboard.

### 6. Face detection

Detect faces and create masks.  Use it for inpainting with the Load Webcam Image node.

### Note

The ControlNet preprocessor slows down the process, so I recommend using other tools to prepare the ControlNet image.

If you want ComfyUI to run continuously, use Auto Queue.

For maximum speed, set the VAE to taesd.
